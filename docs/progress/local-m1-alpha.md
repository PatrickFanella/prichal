# Local M1 implementation progress

The user chose local build and verification first on 2026-09-30. No staging host, provider, public PDS domain or cloud budget has been selected. Work is on `feat/local-m1-alpha`.

M1 depends on the M0 foundation. This branch begins with issue #1, then qualifies the disposable official PDS runtime from issue #4. Live infrastructure work remains pending. Neither local readiness nor a healthy PDS proves public federation or completes M1.

## Foundation evidence

- Pinned Go 1.27.1, Node 24.15.x and pnpm 12.6.0; committed dependency locks and a digest-pinned PostgreSQL image.
- `./scripts/dev.sh smoke` passed: frontend production build, Go vet and race-enabled tests against a new disposable database.
- Migration applies twice, rejects future schema version 999, and commits its version with the schema. The smoke database is isolated and removed afterward.
- Browser at `http://localhost:5173` showed database-backed readiness, then unavailable after stopping only `pds-ass-local-db-1`, then available after restart without reload.
- Measured overflow was false at 375×812, 768×1024, 812×375 and 1440×900.
- The first remote CI run failed because the runner uses Docker bridge networking without service DNS. The second found that its service-ID context is empty. The workflow now starts its own isolated, tmpfs-backed database and records the exact container ID for cleanup. [Gitea run 11325](https://git.subcult.tv/PatrickFanella/pds-ass/actions/runs/11325) passed the build, vet, race tests and clean-database journey on the Kvant runner.

## Official PDS evidence

- Official digest-pinned PDS reported version 0.4.5036. Caddy uses a separate digest pin.
- `./scripts/pds-local.sh qualify` passed health, unauthenticated admin rejection, invitation requirement, `.test` handle domain, unknown-host rejection (421), WebSocket upgrade, invitation persistence across restart, blob-volume canary persistence, and SQLite integrity for all three databases.
- Stopping the PDS produced a 502 through ingress; starting it restored the same checks.
- The PDS has isolated networking, separate persistent SQLite/blob volumes, generated secrets, CPU/memory/PID caps and no Docker socket. Caddy publishes only a loopback port.
- Actual account/record/upload fixtures, disk/account enforcement and database/storage fault injection remain pending under #4. A volume canary is not a repository blob test.

## Remaining local implementation

- Owner OIDC authentication, organization authorization and sessions (#2).
- Restricted node enrollment and execution (#3, #6).
- Transactional durable deployment jobs and resumable status (#5).
- Managed hostname, enrollment, records/media and BYO handle flow (#7–#10).

## Deferred live qualification

Choose staging infrastructure and domains before public DNS/TLS, real email delivery, DID/relay/AppView visibility, cloud convergence and the timed 15-minute journey. Keep the corresponding issues open until their acceptance evidence exists.
